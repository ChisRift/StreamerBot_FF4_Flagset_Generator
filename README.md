# Streamerbot FF4 Flagset Generator code
### By ChisRift51

This code was written by me to work in Streamerbot as an Execute C# Code action.

When triggered, it should randomly generate a flagset which can then be copied and pasted into the Input Flags section on [FF4FE](http://www.ff4fe.com).

It does not currently cover all possible flags, however does have enough elements to it to make an interesting seed.
